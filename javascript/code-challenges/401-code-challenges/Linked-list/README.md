## Collaborators

I worked with Mike (Ike) on the process for the whiteboard and getting the code. We used the base of the traversal function that was written out in the Demo for code challenge 4. I tried to figure this out for a while on my own (the hour had based to work on with Ike). I checked back in with him later and he explained what Josh Coffey had talk to him about. This was an interest and challenging one for sure.
